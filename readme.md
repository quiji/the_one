## Shoot them up

> Be Smart, less feature and more fun gameplay

- > Ridicoulous amount of guns, like stupidly ridiculous amounts
- > Quest systems: All quests are fetch quests, the only thing that changes is the object target name (green macguffin, super macguffin) and the way its presented.
- > Exploding Barrels, period.
- > Healing chickens, period.
